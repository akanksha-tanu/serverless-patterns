# Integration of REST API Gateway with Standard Step Function Workflow containing a Lambda task state

The SAM template orchestrates an integration between an Amazon REST API Gateway endpoint and a step function. The step function definition forwards the payload to a Lambda task state for further processing. 

The template automates the creation of resources including, API Gateway, Step Function, and Lambda, along with their respective IAM roles equipped with minimum required permissions.

Important: this application uses various AWS services and there are costs associated with these services after the Free Tier usage - please see the [AWS Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/) for details. You are responsible for any AWS costs incurred. No warranty is implied in this example.

## Requirements

* [Create an AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) if you do not already have one and log in. The IAM user that you use must have sufficient permissions to make necessary AWS service calls and manage AWS resources.
* [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) installed and configured
* [Git Installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [AWS Serverless Application Model](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html) (AWS SAM) installed

## Deployment Instructions

1. Create a new directory, navigate to that directory in a terminal and clone the GitHub repository:
    ``` 
    git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/serverless-patterns
    ```
1. Change directory to the pattern directory:
    ```
    cd _patterns-model
    ```
1. From the command line, use AWS SAM to deploy the AWS resources for the pattern as specified in the template.yml file:
    ```
    sam deploy --guided
    ```
1. During the prompts:
    * Enter a stack name
    * Enter the desired AWS Region
    * Allow SAM CLI to create IAM roles with the required permissions.

    Once you have run `sam deploy --guided` mode once and saved arguments to a configuration file (samconfig.toml), you can use `sam deploy` in future to use these defaults.

1. Note the outputs from the SAM deployment process. These contain the resource names and/or ARNs which are used for testing.

## How it works

* Send a `POST` request to the "execution" resource path of REST API's "dev" stage.
* The REST API's integration will initiate a synchronous execution of the Step Functions workflow.
* The Step Function will trigger the Lambda function, forwarding the JSON input provided through the API Gateway request for subsequent processing.

## Testing

Run the following command to send an HTTP `POST` request to the REST APIs endpoint. Note, you must edit the {api-stage-url} placeholder with the URL of the deployed REST API's endpoint. This is provided in the stack output.

```bash
curl --location --request POST {api-stage-url} \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \  
--data '{                    
    "key":"value"
}'
```
## Cleanup
 
1. Delete the stack
    ```bash
    aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name STACK_NAME
    ```
1. Confirm the stack has been deleted
    ```bash
    aws cloudformation list-stacks --query "StackSummaries[?contains(StackName,'STACK_NAME')].StackStatus"
    ```
